# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Dan C**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**"Horshees"** is my version of an android app(UI) if horses were to play chess. I took inspiration from my favorite android app, Chess.com with horses as the target users of the fictitious app. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **‚ôüÔ∏èüêéüì≤**

## Notes

I now have a much larger appreciation for user interface(UI) creators, as it was a time consuming process. Despite that, I really enjoyed recreating my favorite app!
